# E-Portfolio

A personal portfolio website built with Pug.js templating and AI-assisted styling.

## Overview

This is my e-portfolio website built with a focus on maintainability and efficient development.

## Technologies

- **Pug.js** - HTML templating for modular components
- **CSS** - AI-assisted styling

## Why This Approach?

**Pug.js for HTML**: I use Pug.js to create modular HTML components that are easy to maintain and update. This keeps the codebase organized and reduces repetition.

**AI-Assisted CSS**: I leveraged AI to help with CSS styling since I don't have much time for design work and it's not my strength. This allowed me to focus on content and functionality.
