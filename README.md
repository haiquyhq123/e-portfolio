# E-Portfolio

My personal portfolio website - simple and easy to maintain.

## Overview

Built this with Pug.js because copy-pasting HTML everywhere was driving me crazy. Now I can update stuff in one place. Much better.

## Technologies

- **Pug.js** - I wrote everything in Pug, compiled it to HTML for GitHub Pages, then let AI add the styling classes and IDs because I suck at CSS and wanted to finish this fast =)) (Turns out AI made my code look clean and professional. Hopefully no one reads this README too carefully lol)

- **CSS** - Claude did all the styling. I just said "looks good" and changed a color or two. (Thanks Claude, you're the real MVP here)

- **Formspree** - Handles contact form emails. Building a whole backend for that? Nah.

## Why This Stack?

Pug keeps things organized, AI does the styling I'd mess up anyway, and I even get clean code out of it. Work smarter, not harder - aka "I let AI fix my CSS skills" ðŸ˜‚
